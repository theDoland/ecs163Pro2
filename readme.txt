I picked the food recall summary dataset from the given datasets

I currently have three visualizations planned out: 
    1. Sunburst chart
    2. Network
    3. Pie chart

So far, I have worked on the network chart and added some interactivity features with it.
This won't be the same as the final version, but it has different years as buttons 
to switch what data is being represented. I also color coded the nodes.
I'm still bug fixing this as there are nodes in the corner that are not being mapped
to nodes that I want. Some miscallaneous things I've done is setup a basic grid and 
wrote a python program to parse the files.
